# Pico FM Synthesizer with DAC
USB MIDI Synthesizer with Raspberry Pi PICO2.  This device works as a USB device and host.  A USB MIDI controller is needed.  
This synthesizer works with FM wave generator, synthio, sound sampler and I2C DAC.  Block diagram is as below.

The FM wave generator is my original program.  It has 4 oscillators (operators), 8 algorithms and 6 basic wave shapes and sampling waves you did it.  

PICO is programmed with circuit python.
